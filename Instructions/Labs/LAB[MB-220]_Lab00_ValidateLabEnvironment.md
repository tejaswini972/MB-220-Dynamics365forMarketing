Module 0: Course introduction
========================

## Practice Lab - Validate lab environment 

Scenario
--------

In this Module 0 lab, you will validate that your classroom tenant is working as expected. You will access your individual credentials, record your “alias”, and open the Dynamics 365 model-driven application that we will be using throughout the course. 

**Important Note:** This lab will provide you with an actual Dynamics 365 tenant
and licenses for the Power Platform applications you will be using in this
course. Please be aware that the Power Platform is evolving all the time. The
instructions in this document may be different from what you experience in your
actual tenant. It is also possible to experience a delay of several
minutes before the virtual machine has network connectivity to begin the labs.

Exercise 1 - Access the Dynamics 365 application
---------------------------------------------------

### Task 1 – Log into the Power Platform admin center

1.  Access <https://admin.Powerplatform.microsoft.com> and log in with your user credentials.

2. Record your user credential up to the **@** symbol on a scratch piece of paper or in Notepad. This will be your lab alias that you will use to differentiate the data you create within the shared Dynamics 365 organization. 

**Important:** Please be aware that this tenant and the Dynamics 365 organization will be shared with the other students in your classroom, like employees would share a tenant when using the Dynamics 365 instance belonging to their organization. Do not use any PII (personally identifiable information) when creating records. It is also good practice to use your username prefix (ex., **mollyc**) in front of all records, data, apps, flows, etc. you create.

3. Feel free to explore the Power Platform admin center but **do not make any changes.**

### Task 2 – Access the Dynamics 365 application

1.  Expand the grid button at the top left of the screen, directly to the left of **Power Platform admin center.** Select **Dynamics 365.**

2.  Select the **Edit** button. You will open the Contoso environment in the **Power Platform admin center.**

4.  From the list of available Dynamics 365 apps, select **Marketing**.

5.  Spend a few minutes exploring the application.

### Task 3 : Upload marketing content 

1.  From the left side menu of the Marketing app, navigate to **Files** in the Marketing Content section and click the **+ Upload** button to open the upload files window. Add the below mentioned 10 image files.

1.  While the upload window is open, click on **Add keywords**  which is under the contosologo image file to add the keywords **logo** and **contoso**.

1.  Since this is a new system, keywords will need to be created instead of selected.

     -   To create a new record, click on **+New Record** then select **keywords** under **Select a record type to create**, give name as **logo** and click on **Save and Close**. The created record will be selected automatically.
     -   Repeat the same process to create one more record **contoso**.  When you’re done adding keywords, click on **Upload**.

1.  Ensure 10 images files uploaded.Using the search bar, type **con** and hit enter and ensure the Contoso logo appears in the search results.
