Module 4: Segments and Lists
======

## Practice Lab 4

Lab Overview
============

Scenario
--------

As Contoso continues preparing their nurture campaign, they need to define the
audience that will participate in the customer journey.

Lab Overview
------------

This lab compromises of three exercises:

1.  In exercise one, you will create a dynamic segment to pull in all contacts
    from the southwest.

2.  In exercise two, you will create two segments – one of your competitors and
    another one to pull in all contacts from the southwest except your
    competitors.

3.  In exercise three, you will create and configure a subscription center page
    and update the system content settings.

 What you’ll need:
------------------

-   A computer with a Dynamics 365 Marketing environment

Exercise 1: Create a dynamic segment 
=====================================

Contoso wants to target contacts who live in the southwest. You previously
uploaded a list of contacts into the system. Now you need to create a segment
pulling in specific contacts. The segment is what will be used in the customer
journey to interact with your intended audience.

1.  Log into Dynamics 365 Marketing.

2.  Navigate to **Segments** in the left menu, in the **Customers** group. Select **+New** and choose **+New Dynamic Segment.**

3.  When prompted to select a Segment Template, click **Skip.** 

4.  In the **Definition** tab, name the segment **[my prefix] Contoso Southwest Segment**. 

5.  Select **Add Query Block.** A box will appear and the entity **Contact** should be selected. If it is not, change the query entity to Contact. Add the following statements:

    - Address 1: State/Province **equals** California 
    
    - Click +Add and select **Add contion to Contact** using **OR**

    - Address 1: State/Province **equals** Arizona
    
    - Click +Add and select **Add contion to Contact** using **OR**

    - Address 1: State/Province **equals** Texas

6.  Save and check for errors. Correct any if needed.

7.  Go live.

8.  Give the system time and refresh if needed. After a few minutes, reopen the segment and navigate to the **Members** tab. Ensure your members match the contacts
    you uploaded.

Exercise 2: Create a segment using union, exclude, or intersect logic
=====================================================================

During further analysis of the contacts, it was found that a few are from a
competitive company, Relecloud. You will want to create a dynamic query pulling
in anyone that comes from Relecloud. You then want to create a new segment using
the exclude logic to make sure these contacts are not included in your customer
journey.

1.  Log into Dynamics 365 Marketing.

2.  Navigate to Segments and create a suppression segment for your competitors.

    - Create a new segment by clicking **+New** and selecting **+New Dynamic Segment.**
    
    - When prompted to select a template, click **Skip.**

    - Name the segment **[my prefix] Relecloud Suppression Segment.**

3. Generate a statement so that: Contact’s Account is Relecloud And Contacts All.

    - Click **Add Query Block.**
    
    - **Contact** should be selected as the query entity.
    
    - Create the following condition: Company Name **equals** Relecloud.

    - Save and check for errors. Correct any if needed.

    - Go live.

3.  Create a segment for all your southwest contacts except your competitors.

    - Create a new segment by clicking **+New** and selecting **+New Dynamic Segment.**
    
    - When prompted to select a template, click **Skip.**

    - Name the segment **[my prefix] Contoso Southwest Excluding Competitors Segment**.

    - Select **Add segment block.**

    - Start by typing your prefix into the Segment field. Select the **[my prefix] Contoso Southwest Segment** segment from Exercise 1.

    - Click **Add Segment Block** again. Change the modifier below to **but not**. Start typing your prefix into the field and select the **[my prefix] Relecloud Suppression Segment** segment.

    - Save and check for errors. Correct any if needed.

    - Go live.

Exercise 3: Create subscription center page and update system content settings
